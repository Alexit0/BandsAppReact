<h1>BandsApp (front-end)</h1> 

<h4>The app where you currently can add musicians and bands to the database and check what musician plays what band after assigning. You can check current lineup and past members after adding them to the database through the app accordingly. App uses spotify web API to display the picture of the band (if the band is present on Spotify and the app's database has that artist's spotify id (-- it must be added to the database manualy))
More functionality is coming.</h4>
